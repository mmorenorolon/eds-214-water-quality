               Stream water is collected weekly at the Luquillo Mountain (Luquillo Experimental Forest) sites listed below. These data sets begin as early as 1983; LTER sampling began in 1988. Stream water samples are grab samples taken from the water/air interface at stream channel center on the sampling day (usually Tuesdays). A continuous record of stream stage (height) is recorded by a datalogger at some ongoing stream sampling sites. Average daily streamflows are available from the USGS and at other locations (Hydrology and Meteorology) on this site. All samples are measured for pH and conductivity, and then filtered (pre-combusted Whatman GF/F glass fiber filter) prior to further analysis. From 1983-1994 samples were cooled and returned to the San Juan chemistry laboratory for analysis. During those years, samples for NH4 and NO3 analyses were refrigerated continuously until analysis. Subsamples for NH4 analysis were also preserved with 1 molar H2SO4. From 1994 on, samples for NH4 and NO3were frozen until analysis, were not acidified, and all analyses were conducted at the University of New Hampshire. Stream water Sampling SitesDescriptions of LTER LUQ stream water weekly sample chemistry data from 1988 onwards. Chemical concentrations are recorded as mg/L or mg/L as appropriate. Values below detection limits are recorded as 1/2 the detection limit.

            In an earlier version of this dataset rainfall and throughfall chemistry were included. The dataset was was split into two, separating the chemistry data from rain and throughfall collectors into LUQMetadata 174: Chemistry of rainfall and throughfall from El Verde and Bisley.

                  Turbidity is the indirect measurement of the suspended solid concentration in water and is typically determined by shining a light beam into the sample solution and then measuring the light that is scattered off of the particles which are present. The suspended solid concentration is an important water quality factor and is a fundamental measure of environmental change. The source of the suspended solids varies in nature (examples include silt, clay, sand, algae and organic matter), but all particles will impact the light transmittance and result in a turbidity signal.

               FNU is similar to Nephelometric Turbidity Units (NTU). Both measure scattered light at 90 degrees from the incident light beam. However, FNU is measured with an infrared light source, while NTU is measured with a white light.
